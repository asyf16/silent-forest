## 🌟 Overview
Silent Forest is an innovative noise management application designed to bring a visual, interactive approach to controlling noise levels in classroom environments. The app features animated characters that react in real-time to the ambient noise levels, providing immediate visual feedback to encourage a quieter, more productive classroom atmosphere.

## 🖌️ Design
The entire scene and all the assets were designed, animated, and hand-drawn by me! I put a lot of love and effort into this little forest. Can you find all the animals?

## 🛠 Technologies Used
**React** – For building the user interface and managing component states.

**Rive** – For creating and animating on-screen characters whose behaviors adapt based on the noise level.

**WebGL** – To render smooth, interactive 3D graphics in the browser.

**Web Audio API**– For real-time audio analysis and triggering character animations based on noise levels.

# 🎯 Features
**Dynamic Character Animations:** On-screen characters whose behavior adapts instantly to changing ambient noise levels, providing visual cues for students and teachers.

**Real-Time Audio Analysis:** The Web Audio API processes ambient noise and adjusts the character animations instantly to reflect loudness, encouraging quieter behavior.

**Interactive Environment:** A visually rich environment where noise changes are communicated in a clear and engaging way.
